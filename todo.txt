File that keeps track of all the improvements and ideas. Could cure cancer one day. For now helps spread it. 
1. Need a way to delete duplicate meme entries in the database.
AR - I was thinking that if the tensorflow classification gave the exact same numbers for two entries, then its essentially the same image and one can be removed. 

2. Have a place on the cloud where the memes are stored and retrieved from. 
AR - A repo/stash into which memes can be inserted. Obviously the server cant be run throughout the day but when ever it is being run, i should be able to upload images into the db.
Images that get uploaded will automatically be parsed and have features inserted into our db.

3. While uploading images, also have a field to tag the actor name. While face identification is not nearly as good as we expected, having the actor tagged while uploading the image will help overcome this partially over time. 

4. Any ideas to improve the face recognition ?

5. Text recognition ? Seems to be doing quite well, but for some false positives in character recognition. 

6. Moonshot - Android App ?!
